Hello all and welcome! If you are veiwing this then that likely means you either have or or about to enjoy my most recent homebrew creation, Bombogenesis IPA. Many of you are probably wondering, "What the hell is a 'Bombogenesis IPA'", lucky for you I HATE CLIFFHANGERS so here you are: 

>Bombogenesis, a popular term used by meteorologists, occurs when a midlatitude cyclone rapidly intensifies, dropping at least 24 millibars over 24 hours. A millibar measures atmospheric pressure. This can happen when a cold air mass collides with a warm air mass, such as air over warm ocean waters. The formation of this rapidly strengthening weather system is a process called bombogenesis, which creates what is known as a bomb cyclone.

In less scientific terms, its a crazy storm. Coincidentally we, people of the East Coast, were just given a first hand lesson in how absolutely insane these weather systems can be. It was on this day that I decided to stay inside and brew this beer.
